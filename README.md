AI saved time on the layout
At first it didn’t make it so I can move between cards and delete them
I refractored my delete deck for more clarity
I made it so you can navigate using keyboard
Being more specific about functionality enabled me to fixed the bugs AI initially created
also when doing so it made my js files really long , 
i waited and did a big commit / push because as i added code i used AI to either fixed up my code or completely change it 
at first it made a page i like but with absoluelty no functionality
